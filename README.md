# Pok√©mon-app

## Notes
- I chose to use this approach because I don't have a specific path available. If I had an endpoint, the path would be set to that endpoint. In cases where there is uncertainty, setting path = "*" would serve as a safeguard against incorrect endpoints. This can be achieved using the Navigate method from react-router-dom.
